# Troubleshooting Object Storage Retention Rules

Learn troubleshooting solutions for issues you might encounter using retention rules.

## Unable to create a retention rule

If creating a retention rule fails, the most likely cause is missing or incomplete IAM permissions. Rule creation requires the following:
- User permissions that let you access the bucket and manage the objects in those buckets.
- Minimally, BUCKET_UPDATE and RETENTION_RULE_MANAGE permissions.

Review the existing policies that grant user permissions. For more information, see[Required IAM Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Troubleshooting/../Tasks/usingretentionrules.htm#Permissions).

## Unable to lock a retention rule

If locking a retention rule fails, the most likely cause is missing or incomplete IAM permissions. Minimally, BUCKET_UPDATE, RETENTION_RULE_MANAGE, and RETENTION_RULE_LOCK permissions are required to lock retention rules.

Review the existing policies that grant user permissions. For more information, see[Required IAM Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Troubleshooting/../Tasks/usingretentionrules.htm#Permissions).

## Unable to delete a retention rule

You can't delete a time-bound retention rule that is locked. When a retention rule is locked, the rule can only be deleted by deleting the bucket. A bucket must be empty before it can be deleted.

If deleting an indefinite retention rule fails, the most likely cause is missing or incomplete IAM permissions. Rule deletion requires:
- User permissions that let you access the bucket and manage the objects in those buckets.
